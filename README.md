<h2>About Joseph K. McMorrow</h2>

My full name is Joseph Kaleb McMorrow, but I prefer to just be called Kaleb. I was born down in Florida and moved to Tennessee later in my life. I enjoy generic hobbies such as reading, exercising, video games, and more recently cooking. I've always been using a computer throughout my life, but only more recently have I actually been learning the more technical aspects. I look forward to having a good semester.
